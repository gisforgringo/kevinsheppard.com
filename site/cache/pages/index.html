<p>I currently work at the University of Oxford as a Financial Econometrician. 
My research focuses on volatility and uncertainty. Measuring and modeling 
conditional correlation, a key input into portfolio risk models is a 
cornerstone of my research.</p>
<p>I have produced a large volume of teaching resources, including a complete 
set of notes in <a href="/teaching/mfe/notes/">Financial Econometrics</a>, and introductions to both 
<a href="/teaching/python/notes/">Python</a> and <a href="/teaching/matlab/notes/">MATLAB</a>. 
I also maintain a number of widely used toolboxes related to my research. The most
broadly used of these are the <a href="/code/matlab/mfe-toolbox">MFE Toolbox for MATLAB</a>, 
and the arch (<a href="https://bashtage.github.io/arch/">documentation</a>, 
<a href="https://github.com/bashtage/arch" aria-label="Visit the arch repository on Github"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a>) 
and linearmodels (<a href="https://bashtage.github.io/linearmodels/">documentation</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bashtage/linearmodels" aria-label="Visit the linearmodels repository on Github"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a>)
modules for Python. See my <a href="https://github.com/bashtage">GitHub page</a> for a 
complete list of projects.</p>
<p>I enjoy hiking and being outdoors, although I don't get out as much as I 
would like. You can see some pictures of my adventures in the <a href="/galleries/">gallery</a>. 
I have a sweet but rambunctious chocolate labrador, <a href="/galleries/Callie-(2015)/">Callie</a>.</p>
