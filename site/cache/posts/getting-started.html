<p>This is the first post on my new site.  This site is a static site generated using <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a>, 
a static-site generator written in Python. I chose it because I know Python pretty well and
so can customize any feature I want. It also natively supports <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a>, which is 
a big plus. </p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>While switching over I seriously considered <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, a generator
written in Go which seems to have a very large and dedicated base. I may eventually switch 
over. Hugo although the Jupyter integration is nearly non-existent (i.e., manually export to
markdown).</p>

<p>For many years I have used <a href="https://mediawiki.org">mediawiki</a> as a Content Management System. 
I found this to be a relatively simple approach since it allowed be to create and populate a page
with links to other documents or files, whether these existed or not. If a page or file did 
not exist, I could click on its link (which has a 404-color code) and either edit the missing
page or add the file.  The wiki software also has a number of special pages that let me see
all missing file.  As a bonus, MediaWiki indexes all content so that the site is immediately 
searchable. There are <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Extensions">many extensions</a> that are helpful in integrating with other services,
e.g., embedding YouTube videos. </p>

<p>What I didn't like about the old site was its fragility.  I regularly received emails telling 
me that my site was down.  These were driven by a connectivity issue with the MariaDB that stored
the site's data or with php-fpm which managed the relationship between the nginx front end
and the PHP engine. My site depended on the correct operation of:</p>
<ul>
<li>nginx</li>
<li>MariaDB</li>
<li>php-fpm</li>
<li>MediaWiki</li>
<li>A DigitalOcean droplet</li>
</ul>
<p>I also didn't like the feeling that I had to regularly patch the software. While I could setup
Ubuntu to automatically apply patches, I was always nervous about doing this with the MediaWiki
software. Instead, I would manually patch when I received an email from their security mailing list.
In addition, I had to occasionally migrate PHP versions when the current LTS increased its minimum
supported version. This was particularly challenging for me since I do not regularly use PHP and so 
I had to reinvent the wheel each time this happened (which I think was only twice, in fairness)</p>
<p>The extension landscape was also very uneven.  Many extensions I tried had no long-term support and 
so would continue to work until they used a feature that had been removed. This required repeatedly 
searching for new extensions, and eventually lead me to remove most of them.  </p>

<p>The new site is static in the sense that it is only a collection of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images
and other content files.  The only server I need is a webserver (e.g., nginx). While I 
am initially hosting it on the same droplet I used for my MediaWiki installation, I plan 
on moving to GitHub pages using <a href="https://travis-ci.com">Travis CI</a> to build the pages.  This will both save my time and
money.</p>

<p>While writing a simple site or pure blog is pretty food proof, Nikola is not a great site generator.
The biggest problems I have faced are (some) lack of out-of-box customizability, lack of
a theme I like, and nothing helping me ensure that I do not have missing or orphan pages.
The upside for me is that these are all pretty simple to fix writing a few custom plugins. 
For example, I wrote one that reads the site contents, file a list of files and finds all
links to these files.  It then uses a couple of set operations to determine if there are
any missing files (really important) or orphan files (less important, but still annoying).</p>
