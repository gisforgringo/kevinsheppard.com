<p><a href="https://www.lyx.org/">LyX</a> is a powerful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editor
for LaTeX. I am an avid user of LyX since it allows for a highly productive environment for 
writing text and formatted math while continuing to allow for a high degree of customizability. 
LyX is an open source version of Scientific Workplace which is both more modern and has broader
compatibility with standard LaTeX.</p>
<p>LyX is cross platform and works equally well on Windows, Linux or OS X.</p>
<p>These videos comprise a basic introduction to LyX and cover the core tools needed to write a 
Thesis or paper in Economics or Econometrics (and many other fields, especially in mathematics, 
statistics or social sciences).</p>

<p>Some people prefer a written guide. Fortunately (for me), a good guide has been written 
(by others) and is available at <a href="http://wiki.lyx.org/uploads/LyX/tutorials/essentials/LyX_Essentials.pdf">Lyx Guide</a>.</p>
